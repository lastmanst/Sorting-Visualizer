I have implemented a comprehensive sorting algorithm visualization project using JavaScript for the core logic. The front end is crafted with HTML and CSS to deliver an intuitive user interface. JavaScript Event Listeners are employed to infuse dynamic behaviour into the components, ensuring a seamless user experience.

To enhance user engagement, a dynamic array size is generated using a Random function, adding an element of unpredictability to each simulation. The utilization of Delay_time and array_speed controls allows users to tailor the visualization speed to their preferences.

A key feature is the ability to generate a new array at any point, fostering a more interactive experience. The layout is meticulously designed with a flex-direction of 'row' to optimize the visual representation of the sorting process.

To ensure a smooth execution flow, once a sorting algorithm initiates, the remaining components are disabled. This prevents any interference during the algorithm's execution, ensuring a focused and distraction-free visualization.

In summary, this project not only provides an educational insight into sorting algorithms but also prioritizes user interaction and visual appeal, making it an effective and engaging tool for learning and exploration."
